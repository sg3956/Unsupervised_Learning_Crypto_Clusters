# Unsupervised_Learning_Crypto_Clusters

The software employs Scikit Learn for the purpose of utilizing unsupervised learning on data related to cryptocurrency. We will use the KMeans algorithm to assist in organizing the data into clusters for improved visualization, and also make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the data for efficient analysis and and more pronounced visualization.
